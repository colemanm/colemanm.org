## Summary

_Seeing Like a State_ is a deep academic, almost textbook-like, analysis of "high modernism" and its failings to deliver on its promises. Looking [to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_modernism "High modernism"), the movement is defined by a confidence, expectation, and reliance on science, technology, and knowledge to reorder social and natural systems according to "better" intentional design. Scott works from a similar definition of the term, spending significant time trying to diagnose _why_ seemingly well-intentioned movements in history have backfired so spectacularly against their stated goals.

The high modernist government bureaucrat, architect, or social organizer looks at the emergent, chaotic natural world and assumes a problem: look at the inefficiency! Look how ugly and disorganized it all is! In attempt to ground-up redesign emergent systems — cities, horticulture, markets — high modernists think they "know better", and can make these systems more efficient through intervention. In particular, Scott is interested in _authoritarian_ high modernism, a flavor of the movement that combines the ideas of the likes of Lenin, Le Corbusier, or Robert Moses and combines them with authoritarian power. It's bad enough to _think_ you know how do design complex societal systems from above, it's another thing entirely to actually attempt to do it.

Scott uses a diverse set of examples to demonstrate high modernism's failings. Rural villagization in Tanzania, ground-up city-building in Brasilia and Chandigarh, collective farming in Russia. Each of these begins from a point of positive objectives, but rapidly proceeds to devalue or reject the complexity of the existing system state. Classic examples of the [Chesterton Fence](https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/ "Chesterton's Fence"). Complex systems are shot through with invisible relationships, complexity, and illegible details. But the ivory tower bureaucrat looks at a byzantine "backward" system of land tenure in Russia and assumes a lack of knowledge or expertise. There are countless examples throughout history of centralized, top-down attempts to reorder societies blowing up in our faces. Yet somehow the high modernist experts continue their attempts to [green-field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_project "Greenfield project").

The central thesis is that a movement to make things "legible" to outsiders naturally promotes authoritarian behavior. Every move to centralize or make legible a complex system comes with a raft of trade-offs that are often shunted aside or disrespected.

## Key Takeaways

* Legibility from the center isn't all negative; but major trade-offs are being made (whether understood or invisible) when pulling systems, traditions, and decision making up from the local level
* Rules of thumb how to maintain a progressive society without slipping into authoritarian high modernism
	* Take small steps
		* An experimental approach to social change
		* Observe systemic reactions at smaller scale
	* Favor reversability
		* Make small, editable or reversable mistakes
	* Plan on surprises
		* A pragmatic, realistic approach would assume occasional failure and respond accordingly, versus being totally captured by a plan's genius
		* In complex systems, _adaptation_ is the way forward
	* Plan on human inventiveness
		* Do not treat subjects of plan as agency-less pawns, but rather as individual motivated actors that will react to a plan's implementation
