<h1>Talks</h1>

<p>I've occasionally given talks and presentations at events, and enjoy doing it. I'm not the most confident public speaker in the world, so talking
about things I'm passionate about helps me improve. Here are a few that I've done.</p>

{% assign talks = site.talks %}
{% for talk in talks %}
<p class="title"><a href="{{ talk.url }}"><strong>{{ talk.title | xml_escape }}</strong></a> &mdash; <a href="{{ talk.eventlink }}">{{ talk.event }}</a></p>

<div class="image"><a href="{{ talk.url }}" class="img"><img src="{{ talk.image }}" alt="{{ talk.title | xml_escape }}" /></a></div>
{% endfor %}
