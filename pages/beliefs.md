# Things I Believe

One of the best ways to get to know someone is to peek behind the curtain, and get a look at the core beliefs that drive their personality — as if everyone had a personal, _honest_, self-curated Wikipedia entry. Here are some of mine. Many of them I've written about in my newsletter, **[Res Extensa](https://www.resextensa.co/ "Res Extensa, by Coleman McCormick")** (linked inline):

- Problems should be found and addressed closest to their source
  - Hierarchy, modularity, and subsidiarity allow solutions to develop bottom-up
  - See "[Pace layering](https://www.resextensa.co/p/book-notes-stewart-brand-how-buildings-learn "How Buildings Learn, by Stewart Brand")"
- Decentralizing things solves most complex problems
  - Centralization gets things done quickly (makes it attractive), but results in less durability / resiliency
  - Large, top-down systems are resistant to evolving along with the problem space; they're resistant to change
  - Decentralized systems create an ecosystem of experiments for finding novelty; they expand the "search space"
- Truly complex systems [confound all attempts to control them](https://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw.html "The Use of Knowledge in Society")
  - Especially true when humans are involved — individual agency is a massively mystifying variable
- The only way to resist bad ideas is to [create better ones](https://www.colemanm.org/books/rauch-kindly-inquisitors/ "Kindly Inquisitors, by Jonathan Rauch")
  - Winning should happen through argument and empirical result, not bans and suppression
  - Free speech causes genuinely bad ideas to be exposed as such: the critique (and quantity thereof) is just as public as the idea itself
  - Bad ideas kept underground don't go away naturally
- Innovation only happens through experimentation, exploring the "adjacent possible"
  - Stop wondering, start tinkering
- You can just go build things
  - Innovation is permissionless, it only requires your knowledge, agency, and resolve
- Speed is the antidote to many problems
  - The faster you can move or decide, the faster you can eliminate the wrong paths (and find the best ones)
  - Progress is a game of testing out the most "stepping stones"
  - The faster you iterate, the longer you can continue to play
- Reading books is the highest ROI learning tool you have
  - You have access to the collective knowledge of civilization for (essentially) free
  - Building and tinkering a close second (any craft or art counts)
- Writing is the best augmenter of your thinking
  - A forcing function to actually articulate and express what's inside your head
  - Bonus points for making your ideas public
- [Constraints are a blessing, not a curse](https://www.resextensa.co/p/embrace-constraints "Embrace Constraints")
  - Truly creative solutions are driven by constraint
  - Unbounded environments aren't the benefit they appear to be
- On Companies
  - Your company culture is the [product of the decisions you make](https://www.resextensa.co/p/how-cultures-accumulate "How Cultures Accumulate")
    - To change culture, start making different decisions
  - [Small teams are a superpower](https://www.resextensa.co/p/the-superpower-of-small-teams "The Superpower of Small Teams")
    - Lower decision cost
    - Easier to maintain a [bias to action](https://www.resextensa.co/p/take-action-invite-criticism "Take Action, Invite Criticism")
    - You get to avoid the "work paper shredder"
    - [Context is that which is scarce](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/02/context-is-that-which-is-scarce-2.html "Context is that which is scarce") — smallness retains a high signal-to-noise ratio for transmitting valuable context
  - Teams want leadership, not collectivism
    - Even high-performing, creative teams need direction, a point of view, conviction, spiritual motivation — can be from within, not merely above
    - Collectivizing decisions within "The Team" only creates the illusion of progress
