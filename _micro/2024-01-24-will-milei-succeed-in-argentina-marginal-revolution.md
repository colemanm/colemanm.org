  title: Will Milei succeed in Argentina? - Marginal REVOLUTION

Tyler Cowen is hopeful (as am I), but skeptical:

For a country to swing so wildly from state-run strangulation to an quasi-populist libertarian economist makes me worried his effect on Argentine bureaucracy will fade in the next 12 months.

But [his Davos talk](https://x.com/aphysicist/status/1747868626948907325?s=20) was phenomenal. Should be shown in high school classrooms.
