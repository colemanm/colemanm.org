  title: "Muse \u2013 Prompts for journaling"
---

Sometimes in a journaling session it’s hard to get yourself writing. You need a kickstart, an idea to latch onto and get your brain moving. I know I do when it’s 5:30am and I sit down to write.

So I built a simple tool for displaying journaling prompts called **[Muse](https://muse.colemanm.xyz/)**. It’s open source [on GitHub](https://github.com/colemanm/muse). You can run it yourself and edit a single file to add or modify the prompts it uses.

This is the first entry in my mission to ship at least one small tool or product each month this year.
