Firefly Aerospace became the first private company to land a spacecraft on the moon when [Blue
Ghost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_Aerospace_Blue_Ghost) lunar lander touched down on the moon on March 2nd.

What an incredible achievement â€“ and that 4K video from the lunar surface is just mesmerizing.
