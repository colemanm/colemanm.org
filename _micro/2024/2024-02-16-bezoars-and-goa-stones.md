I just learned about**bezoars and[Goa stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa_stone)** (a man-made form of bezoar). It’s a chunk of aggregated minerals, seeds, piths, and other indigestible material that forms in the intestinal system of animals. People would shave off small bits and add to tea and beverages for medicinal purposes.

The way humans discover things without understanding why they work is endlessly fascinating.

Love this description:

The stones made their way to England as well and an early mention is made in 1686 by Gideon Harvey who was sceptical of the curative value noting that they were confected from a “ _jumble of Indian Ingredients_ ” by “ _knavish Makers and Traffickers.’_ ”
