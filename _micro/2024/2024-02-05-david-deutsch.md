> A gene pool is carved and whittled through generations of ancestral natural selection to fit [a particular] environment. **In theory a knowledgeable zoologist, presented with the complete transcript of a genome [the set of all the genes of an organism], should be able to reconstruct the environmental circumstances that did the carving. In this sense the DNA is a coded description of ancestral environments.**  
  
—In _The Living Wild_ , Art Wolfe (2000)

(from David Deutsch’s _[The Beginning of Infinity](https://www.colemanm.org/books/deutsch-the-beginning-of-infinity/)_)

The organism is a key to decoding its environment.
