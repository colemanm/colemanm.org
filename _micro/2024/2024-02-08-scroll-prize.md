A group of researchers just [won the Scroll Prize](https://scrollprize.org/grandprize), a project to read the ancient [Herculaneum papyri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herculaneum_papyri), burned and buried in the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD.

Using AI and computer vision techniques they were able to discern text from the rolled, charred, and brittle papyrus. An unbelievable feat.
