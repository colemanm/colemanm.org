**Chillon Castle** , island fortress on Lake Geneva, Switzerland.

The building originally dates to the 11th century, but there’s evidence the Romans had forts on the small island a millennium earlier. 

It’s functioned as fort, prison, and summer home to counts and dukes. Added to my one-day-Swiss-vacation list.
