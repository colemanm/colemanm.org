**[Bell Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Island_\(Franz_Josef_Land\)), **part of the Franz Josef Land archipelago in Russia.

I couldn’t believe this:

The island was the first among the Franz Josef archipelago to be visited by [Benjamin Leigh Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Leigh_Smith) in his 1880 expedition. In his second expedition to the islands in 1881, Smith built a wooden lodge on the north side of the island which he used to winter. The lodge stands to this day.

A small wooden shack, built on an island in the Arctic Ocean, stands for 150 years. Will think about that next time I’m building something.
