title: Humongous Fungus
---

In LibertyRPF's [latest newsletter](https://www.libertyrpf.com/p/589-oracles-half-trillion-gambit), he makes brief mention of the "Humongous fungus", an *Armillaria ostoyae* fungus that covers roughly 2,385 acres of Oregon forest, and weighs an estimated 35,000 tons.

When you read enough about mycology, you find some science fiction-level stuff:

> Most of this giant fungus is underground as a network of mycelium and rhizomorphs, black or dark brown structures that are kind of like roots or shoelaces.
> 
> The mushrooms you might see on a hike in the forest are just temporary fruiting bodies, like apples on a tree. The real organism is this vast, interconnected web beneath the forest floor that slowly spreads by feeding on tree roots.

Why are we looking for aliens in space? They're already here on Earth.
