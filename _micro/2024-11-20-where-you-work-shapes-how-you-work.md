  title: Where You Work Shapes How You Work
---

Our levels of productivity, creativity, and inspiration have an intimate, hard-to-articulate connection to our environments. And we all have different predilections â€” quiet vs. noisy, calm vs. bustling, light vs. dark. Each quality creates a climate that pulls something different out of us.

Our surroundings shape how we work, yet we also have the power to [choose and to mold them ourselves](https://www.resextensa.co/p/shaping-our-environments).
