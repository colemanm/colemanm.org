At the [State of the Map US](http://stateofthemap.us/) conference in Portland, I talked about a pet project of mine: mapping marine data in [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org/) to build beautiful, open data-based nautical charts. The [OpenSeaMap](http://openseamap.org/) project is a sub-project of OSM to map aids-to-navigation, channels, ports, and marine facilities to create a database of free, easy-to-use nautical data.
