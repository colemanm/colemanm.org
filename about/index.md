# About

Hi. I'm Coleman McCormick, a product guy living in St. Petersburg, Florida with my wife and two kids. I've spent my career in technology, starting out as a geographer with an IT background, now evolved into product management. Currently I'm working on [Fulcrum](https://www.fulcrumapp.com "Fulcrum"), a low-code platform for field services.

**colemanm.org** is my personal blog which I first started back in 2010. I post about a variety of topics that interest me, including product development, technology, economics, philosophy, writing, books, and more. I'm an avid runner and sports fan, so sometimes there's a sprinkling of posts on athletics.

Since October 2018 I've written a post every day here on the site. It's an exercise in creating a writing habit, and a personal challenge to see how long I can keep it up.

I'm a supporter of RSS and the open web, so the best way to follow what I'm writing about is to [subscribe to the feed](/atom.xml "colemanm.org RSS"). If you want to get in touch, I'm easily accessible on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/colemanm "@colemanm on Twitter") or email @ coleman at mcco dot me. You'll also find me in a few other places on the internet like [GitHub](https://github.com/colemanm "Coleman on GitHub"), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/colemanm "Coleman on LinkedIn"), and a few [talks on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLwa5sH_6pCdgk4DPDfVfS1AiR7babPNQ "Coleman's Talks").

## Series

I have a few recurring series posts that I return to on occasion.

* **Weekend Reading** — A weekly digest posted on Saturdays with 3 links of recent interest. Sometimes news, sometimes apps, anything I found interesting in #InternetExploration.
* **Best Songs** — A while ago my dad and I were [talking about collecting playlists](/post/best-songs-part-1-chameleon/ "Best Songs") of our all-time favorite songs. The main criteria is "songs personally meaningful to you." There are many in my personal archive, so I post one every now and then.
* **Places** — where I snapshot and write short posts about interesting places on the globe.
