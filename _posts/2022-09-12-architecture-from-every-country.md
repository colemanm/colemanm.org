This was a [fantastic thread](https://twitter.com/culturaltutor/status/1569514639905669120 "Architecture examples from every country") from The Cultural Tutor — so simple, but had me on an epic Wikipedia / Google Maps rabbit hole.  

Some of my favorite examples:

- [Las Lajas Shrine, Colombia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Lajas_Shrine)  
- [Samtavisi Cathedral, Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samtavisi_Cathedral)  
- [Monastery of the Holy Trinity, Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery_of_the_Holy_Trinity,_Meteora)  
- [Borobudur, Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borobudur)  
- [Fortifications of Kotor, Montenegro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortifications_of_Kotor)  

Kind of sad to see so many overbearing modernist structures in here, but some of them are nothing if not impressive, at least.  

His newsletter, [Areopagus](https://culturaltutor.com/areopagus "Areopagus Newsletter"), is full of great tidbits on art, history, classics, architecture, rhetoric. Well worth a subscribe.
