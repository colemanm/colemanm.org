The latest issue of Res Extensa, on the path from "simplistic" to "simple" understanding, over the hill of complexity:

> Superficial simplicity is our first impression, a naïve jump to conclusion. Simplicity on the other side of complexity is wisdom. Wisdom comes to us in rules of thumb, heuristics, knowledge gained from hard-won experience. The experience comes from grappling with the complexity so we can distill with simplicity.
>
> Profound solutions are simple, but they're post-complexity simple. Elegant, robust solutions are rooted in deep understanding. Whether they're laws, books, or products, the ones with the most impact climbed over the complexity hill for us.
