In this AI era, I've been thinking a lot about what it means for humans in the loop of formerly human tasks. When AI is inserted in all layers of the
stack, what's left for us?

Sari Azout hits on something I agree with: that the intangibles are (at least for now) resistant to AI. And these areas tend to be where we humans
find joy in creativity in the first place. Taste, building context, intersecting divergent ideas, a respect for the tactile, the ephemeral, the
unpredictable.

> First, you need to cultivate a deeper relationship with your gut. The more our world becomes measurable and quantifiable, the more we need spaces that preserve what can't be measured—the hunches we can't explain, the patterns we feel but can't prove. A jazz musician knows when to break rules in ways no theory explains. A good copywriter can feel what words will land without having a single data point to prove it. Taste isn't some mysterious gift bestowed at birth—it's simply what happens when you pay close attention to what moves you.

Our minds are good at finding patterns in the unquantifiable.
