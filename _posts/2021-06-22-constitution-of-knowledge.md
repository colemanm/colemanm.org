Jonathan Rauch's latest book _[The Constitution of Knowledge](https://amzn.to/3xX4g83 "The Constitution of Knowledge")_ just dropped, which sounds sort of like a sequel, or at least a _redux_ of his classic _[Kindly Inquisitors](/books/rauch-kindly-inquisitors/ "Jonathan Rauch, Kindly Inquisitors — Summary and Notes")_.

Brookings held a panel on his book's release with historian [Anne Applebaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Applebaum "Anne Applebaum") and novelist [Neal Stephenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson "Neal Stephenson") (yes, that Neal Stephenson). In _Constitution_ he follows up his ideas on liberal science and free speech with further work on institutional decay, social coercion, and disinformation.

I wrote about _Kindly Inquisitors_ and Rauch's liberal science concept in [Res Extensa #9: Liberal Science — Fallibilism and Error Correction](https://resextensa.substack.com/p/liberal-science-fallibilism-and-error "Liberal Science — Fallibilism and Error Correction"). His work covers critical first principles that we're gradually navigating away from.
