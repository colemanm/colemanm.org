I've been diving back into Alexander's [A Pattern Language](/books/alexander-a-pattern-language/ "Christopher Alexander, A Pattern Language") the past few days.

As I was making notes in Obsidian, it occurred to me that APL, with its interlinked system of patterns, could be an interesting medium for building a relationship graph around. Patterns connected to patterns.

Then looking around I ran across essentially this exact thing: a web-published version of an Obsidian graph of patterns.

Browsing to any pattern shows you the subgraph of adjacent patterns, with backlinks to each one. A neat way to traverse the relationships of Alexander's system.
