Will Manidis:

> The demonic recognizes in our shortcuts the perfect opportunity: tempt humans away from the difficult labor of making, growing, and building with our own hands and minds. Instead, offer an endless stream of effortless consumptionâ€”images without artists, music without musicians, stories without storytellers. The devilâ€™s oldest strategy is, of course, promising godlike creation without godlike effort.

Every feed, every product shelf, every book rack, even restaurant and menu, now overflowing with slop. If we're being honest, the slop movement â€” mass produced, carbon-copied, no connection to humans â€” predates AI. But AI turbocharges the ability to churn this stuff out.
