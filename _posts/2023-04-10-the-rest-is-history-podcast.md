Recently I've been thoroughly enjoying Tom Holland's _[Dominion](/books/holland-dominion/ "Dominion, Tom Holland")_, his epic history of Christianity and its influence on western culture. It's one of the most interesting (and well-written) works of history I've read in some time. Holland approaches the subject from a historical and classicist perspective, versus a religious or theological one, which is unique for many religious histories. And he does so very respectfully of the faith itself, not with a cold, matter-of-fact historian's eye.

Because it's been great so far, Holland has a few other books I've added to the reading backlog, including works on the Persians and the fall of the Roman Empire.

Through reading more about him I also discovered his podcast, hosted by him and Dominic Sandbrook, another historian, mostly focused on modern history. Their show is excellent, and every episode so far has been a pleasure. My binging streak started from the early episodes, but I've jumped around a good bit to different topics I'm more curious about.
