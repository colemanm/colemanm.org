Sam Arbesman shared this post in his [newsletter](https://arbesman.substack.com/ "Sam Arbesman's Substack") â€” highlights from Maxis's annual letter (the makers of SimCity, the Sims, SimEarth, SimTower, etc.).  

As much as it seems like the simulation tech Maxis developed over the years was all about top-down, "god mode" design â€”Â especially in SimCity â€”Â they're just as impressive for the emergent gameplay they pioneered. SimLife was literally about watching evolution play out, followed up by an even-more-advanced experiment with evolution in Spore.
