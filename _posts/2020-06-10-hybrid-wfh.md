Interesting perspective here on the effectiveness of hybrid in-office/WFH models of work, which are likely to be popular in reopening cautiously:

> Hybrid structures are hard to get right because, baseline working methodology will be entirely different. And I don't mean pair programming, which can still be done using VS Code Share or what have you. I mean the decision making structures. How an organisation makes decisions sets the culture, defines your hiring and creates the career path for leadership.
