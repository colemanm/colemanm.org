{% include video.html id="j0MKhlLTav4" title="Keith Rabois on This Week in Startups" %}

When I first heard about his company [Opendoor](https://www.opendoor.com/ "Opendoor") (a real estate startup with the goal of creating faster liquidity for home sellers), I started following [Keith Rabois](https://twitter.com/rabois "Keith Rabois on Twitter"). His Twitter account is a good follow.

This discussion covered topics as diverse as his political views, his original ideas for his companies, and investing principles.
