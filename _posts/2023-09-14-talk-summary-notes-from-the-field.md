Back in early August I gave a talk at the TUgis Conference at Towson University, one of the best regional GIS industry events on the east coast.

The title was "Notes from the Field: Best Practices Designing Field Data Processes". Drawn my decade-plus of experience working with teams doing field data collection — primarily with Fulcrum, but often just the general principles of good workflow — I wanted to draw some parallels I've found between my own world of software product development and how to design fieldwork projects.
