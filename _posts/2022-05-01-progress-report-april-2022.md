This month was a weak one on the health front. I think I only got 2 or 3 runs in, and my sleep has been garbage. Maybe I can do better in May. We have plans to join the gym nearby, so that should coerce at least working out semi-weekly. If I could get to 3 runs per week and 2 workout sessions, I'd be happy to build from that.

I did, however, make inroads on eating better and cooking at home, so that's a plus.
