If you don't follow [Cultural Tutor](https://twitter.com/culturaltutor "@culturaltutor") on Twitter, I'd highly recommend. One of the few threadposters who consistently sends me down unrequested-but-fascinating rabbit holes. Architecture, classical history, music, art ‚Äî¬†always something interesting.

And if you like the social media feed, check out [Areopagus](https://areopagus.culturaltutor.com/ "Areopagus"), his weekly newsletter that goes deeper on a few topics each week.
