Ezra Klein recently hosted Stripe founder Patrick Collison on his podcast for a deep dive into his thinking on [progress studies](/post/progress-is-not-automatic/ "Progress is Not Automatic").

Tracking down the origins of what generates progress, and what compels things like substantial breakthroughs in scientific research is a hard problem. Clearly there's no monocausal explanation. I like Patrick's idea here that specific attributes of *research culture* might be key contributors:
 
> If we kind of accept that, and we try to ask ourselves, well, specifically, what are the mechanisms? You know, whatâ€™s actually going on? Itâ€™s hard for me to say. It seems like the transmission of research culture by individual researchers matters a great deal.
>
> And you see these kinds of pockets of the cultural transmission repeatedly crop up, where Gerty and Carl Cori â€” you probably havenâ€™t heard of â€” they ran a little biology lab in Missouri, and no fewer than six of their trainees, of students they trained, went on themselves again to win Nobel Prizes.
>
> And if we tell ourselves a standard kind of mechanistic story as to, well, itâ€™s the funding level, itâ€™s how much are we investing in science, or itâ€™s something about whether thereâ€™s an institution in the courser sense, that can possibly be amenable to it, itâ€™s very hard to explain these eddies where you see these pockets of excellence really produce these outsized returns. So I think itâ€™s a complicated question.
>
> I think all of aggregate culture, funding, institutional characteristics, and so on all contribute to it. But if I had to isolate a single variable, it seems to me that the research culture set by specific people and the tacit knowledge transmitted through direct experience is probably the number-one thing.

Cultural factors are some of the hardest contributors to measure, which could be a reason why explaining where the enlightenment and human progress come from in the first place.
