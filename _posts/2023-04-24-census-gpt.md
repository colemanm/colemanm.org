Census GPT is an open source tool put together by a new team working on product applications for GPT-4. It lets you write natural language questions to query the US Census database â€”Â things like the [cities in Florida with the highest crime](https://censusgpt.com/?s=Five+cities+in+Florida+with+the+highest+crime). It even shows the SQL output that GPT generates from your query.

Check out the [project on GitHub](https://github.com/caesarHQ/textSQL "textSQL"), and join the [their Discord](https://discord.com/invite/JZtxhZQQus "textSQL on Discord") to see what other kinds of datasets and use cases they're tinkering with.
