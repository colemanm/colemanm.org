Iain McGilchrist:

> Who does not now find themselves constantly busy? The young, the middle-aged and the old feel it alike. We are all time-poor; and time is not worth nothing. Time is life. Everything now is freighted with so much bureaucracy; and the bureaucracy is in an unholy alliance with AI. Together they massively, colossally, waste our time.

As he reminds us in this piece, we’ve got to stay vigilant here. Bureaucracy + AI is a dangerous combination for all our sanity (and likely worse).

We’ve already seen the enshittification of everything powered by financialization and dehumanization and “optimizations” for efficiencies, or for economies of scale. AI is superfuel for this nonsense.

I’m bullish on free markets and humans selecting against this world, as long as we have options. Let’s build and maintain those options.
