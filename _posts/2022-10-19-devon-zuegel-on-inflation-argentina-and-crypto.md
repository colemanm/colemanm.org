Argentina has become infamous for its decades-long [struggles with inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_Argentina "Economic history of Argentina") and economic instability. For an otherwise fairly well-off nation, it's surprising to outsiders how deep the problem on this has been.  

In this episode of EconTalk, [Devon Zuegel](https://twitter.com/devonzuegel "Devon Zuegel on Twitter") talks about [an article she wrote](https://www.freethink.com/technology/crypto-argentina-black-market-cash "The crypto black markets of Argentina") on this topic, after spending time there and investigating the problems for herself. What's most surprising about all this is how pervasive a problem it is. Inflation touches *everyone*; everyone is hyper-aware of money issues and constantly thinking about techniques to avoid inflation's negative impacts.
