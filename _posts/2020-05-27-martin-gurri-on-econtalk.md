I've been following Gurri's work closely since I read _The Revolt of a Public_ a couple months back. I think he's one of the sharpest minds we have right now thinking and writing about what's going on in politics, media, and public opinion.

He was on [this week's EconTalk](https://www.econtalk.org/martin-gurri-on-the-revolt-of-the-public/ "Martin Gurri on the Revolt of the Public") talking to Russ Roberts about his book. The show notes for the episode provide excellent additional material on his core ideas.
