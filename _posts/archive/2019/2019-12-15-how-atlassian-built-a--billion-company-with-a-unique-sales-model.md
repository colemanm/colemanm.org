I enjoyed a couple of notes from this interview with [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/ "Atlassian") President Jay Simons. They've famously built a business with bottom-up adoption dynamics, allowing them to hit the $1bn revenue milestone without a traditional sales-led model. It's especially impressive how they've been able to do that while also successfully going upmarket to larger and larger customers, who are typically high-touch by default.

My favorite comment:

> "We think of the funnel as a product. Potentially when a customer raises their hand, when they actually need to talk to you, that's a bug."

Treating the adoption model and process as a product itself is a great way to think about the a[dvantages of SaaS](/post/the-magic-of-recurring-revenue/ "The Magic of Recurring Revenue"). You're building a machine that generates recurring revenue, so tuning the machine to be as efficient as possible (after product-market fit) is massive for growth.
