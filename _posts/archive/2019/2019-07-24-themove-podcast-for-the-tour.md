Lance Armstrong's been doing [THEMOVE podcast](https://wedu.team/themove "THEMOVE") on the Tour for 3 years now, the first being the 2017 Tour when I [spent so much time](/post/tour-de-france-2019/ "Tour de France 2019") watching both the Tour itself and the podcast (then known as STAGES). On the show they do a stage-by-stage breakdown each day, with segments on the best rider of the stage, recap the days major changes, analyze the sprint finishes and mountain attacks, and make predictions on future team tactics. It's a fun show, but also gives insight from two guys who rode in the Tour many times (Lance and his former teammate and 17-time Tour rider [George Hincapie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hincapie "George Hincapie")) on how the team dynamics work and a lot of the off-the-road experiences go for a group of guys competing in such a brutal endurance event.

This year Lance's former team director from the US Postal days, [Johan Bruyneel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Bruyneel "Johan Bruyneel"), has been doing a separate set of episodes from a team manager's perspective. It's cool to hear the differences in point of view between rider and director and what they look for.
