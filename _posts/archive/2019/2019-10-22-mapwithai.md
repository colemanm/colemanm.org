In a conversation yesterday I learned about this project called [RapiD](https://github.com/facebookincubator/RapiD "RapiD"), led by Facebook to use computer vision technology to detect features for mapping in OpenStreetMap. Theyâ€™re working on a fork of the iD editor that does assistive feature detection to present an editor with generated geometries to add to the map. I messed around with it in the test areas theyâ€™re supporting so far and itâ€™s a clever combination of computer-assisted detection and human-based mapping. This shows some promise to enhance OSM contributor technology and lower the barrier to entry for new editors.
