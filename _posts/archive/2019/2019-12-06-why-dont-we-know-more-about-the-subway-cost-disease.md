Alex Tabarrok linked to [this detailed deck](https://pedestrianobservations.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/costspresentation2.pdf "Construction Costs") from Alon Levy picking apart the possible reasoning for why NYC subway construction is _so much_ more than other urban centers around the world.

> Levy is to be lauded for his pioneering work on this issue yet isnâ€™t it weird that a Patreon supported blogger has done the best work on comparative construction costs mostly using data from newspapers and trade publications? New York plans to spend billions on railway and subway expansion. If better research could cut construction costs by 1%, it would be worth spending tens of millions on that research. So why doesnâ€™t the MTA embed accountants with every major project in the world and get to the bottom of this cost disease?

Levy's detailed dataset [is here](https://pedestrianobservations.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/construction-costs-2.xls "Subway costs data"). See also [this Josh Barro piece](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/why-we-cant-figure-out-why-infrastructure-is-so-expensive.html "Hereâ€™s Why Weâ€™ve Failed to Figure Out Why Infrastructure Costs So Much") on infrastructure costs, and Patrick Collison's archive of [quickly-completed construction projects](https://patrickcollison.com/fast "Quickly completed projects") for counterpoints to the slowness problem.
