Dr. Keith Flaherty is an oncologist specializing in targeted therapy treatments, with a background in studying and treating varieties of melanoma. I listened to [this extended interview](https://peterattiamd.com/keithflaherty/ "Keith Flaherty on The Drive") with him on Peter Attia's *The Drive* podcast, which was an excellent deep dive into lots of oncology subjects.

> Keith dives into the topic of immunotherapy, probably the most exciting recent development in cancer therapy, and also provides us a rundown of his notion of a different approach to cancer that attacks all the essential pillars of cancer growth and survival.

As a [survivor/patient myself](/post/the-breakthrough-immunotherapy/ "The Breakthrough and Immunotherapy"), and having received a full round of immunotherapy treatment for colorectal disease that (at the time) was a *brand new* option for patients with my situation, I love that someone is out there doing this and having this no-holds-barred technical conversations on radical, important new treatments. One of the best ways to get more support behind research like this is to have wider exposure to the amazing work folks are doing in the field, and showcase how intricate and wildly complicated cancer is. For patients it's also incredibly helpful to have a deeper understanding of the mechanics of a terrifying disease.
