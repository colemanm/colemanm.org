This is a good interview with a great interviewer, [Russ Roberts](https://twitter.com/EconTalker "Russ Roberts on Twitter") of [EconTalk](https://www.econtalk.org/ "EconTalk"). His is probably my favorite podcast â€” if I only listen to 1 episode a week, it's the latest EconTalk.

On Adam Smith, _[The Theory of Moral Sentiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Theory_of_Moral_Sentiments "The Theory of Moral Sentiments")_, the topics he covers on EconTalk, and economic concepts that are valuable to tech founders.
