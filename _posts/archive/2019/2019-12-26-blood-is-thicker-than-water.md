This article is excerpted from Steve Stewart-Williams's latest book, _[The Ape that Understood the Universe](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38651604-the-ape-that-understood-the-universe "The Ape that Understood the Universe")_. On the purposes of altruism and kin selection: 

> The details of Hamiltonâ€™s theory are complex, but the basic idea is fairly simple. The starting point is the observation that organisms share a larger fraction of their genes with relatives than they do with unrelated individuals. This has an important implication, namely that any gene that contributes to the development of a tendency to help oneâ€™s relatives has a better than average chance of being located as well in the recipients of that help. As a result, by helping oneâ€™s relatives to survive and reproduce, one can indirectly help to spread the genes that gave rise to that very tendency.

I'm currently reading Rory Sutherland's _[Alchemy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26210508-alchemy "Alchemy")_, which is full of evolutionary concepts and factoids like this, even though it's ostensibly about marketing, bias, and decision making. Stewart-Williams's book sounds right up there; will add it to the list.
