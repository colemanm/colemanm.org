### 📝 [nvULTRA](https://nvultra.com/ "nvULTRA")

This is a new notes app from Brett Terpstra (creator of nvALT) and Fletcher Penney (creator of MultiMarkdown). I [used nvALT for years]({{ site.url }}/post/writing-workflow/ 
Writing Workflow") for note taking on my Mac. This new version looks like a slick reboot of that with some more power features. In private beta right now, but hopefully dropping soon.

### ⚗️ [We Need a New Science of Progress](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/ "We Need a New Science of Progress")

> Progress itself is understudied. By “progress,” we mean the combination of economic, technological, scientific, cultural, and organizational advancement that has transformed our lives and raised standards of living over the past couple of centuries. For a number of reasons, there is no broad-based intellectual movement focused on understanding the dynamics of progress, or targeting the deeper goal of speeding it up. We believe that it deserves a dedicated field of study. We suggest inaugurating the discipline of “Progress Studies.”

[Patrick Collison](https://twitter.com/patrickc "Patrick Collison") and [Tyler Cowen](https://twitter.com/tylercowen "Tyler Cowen") co-authored this piece for *The Atlantic* making the case for a new science to study how we create progress.

> Looking backwards, it’s striking how unevenly distributed progress has been in the past. In antiquity, the ancient Greeks were discoverers of everything from the arch bridge to the spherical earth. By 1100, the successful pursuit of new knowledge was probably most concentrated in parts of China and the Middle East. Along the cultural dimension, the artists of Renaissance Florence enriched the heritage of all humankind, and in the process created the masterworks that are still the lifeblood of the local economy. The late 18th and early 19th century saw a burst of progress in Northern England, with the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. In each case, the discoveries that came to elevate standards of living for everyone arose in comparatively tiny geographic pockets of innovative effort. Present-day instances include places like Silicon Valley in software and Switzerland’s Basel region in life sciences.

> George Hotz is the founder of [Comma.ai](http://comma.ai/ "Comma.ai"), a machine learning based vehicle automation company. He is an outspoken personality in the field of AI and technology in general. He first gained recognition for being the first person to carrier-unlock an iPhone, and since then has done quite a few interesting things at the intersection of hardware and software.
