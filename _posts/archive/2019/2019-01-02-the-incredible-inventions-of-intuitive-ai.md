This talk on "generative AI" was interesting. One bit stuck out to me as really thought-provoking:

Dutch designers have created a system to 3D print functional things in-place, like [this bridge concept](https://www.popsci.com/bridge-printer "3D printed bridge"). Imagine that you can place a machine, give it a feed of raw material input and cut it loose to generate something in physical space. As the presenter mentions at the end of the talk, moving from things that are "constructed" to ones that are "grown".
