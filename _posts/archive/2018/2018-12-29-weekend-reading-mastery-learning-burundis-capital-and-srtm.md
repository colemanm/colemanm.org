### 🎓 [Mastery Learning and Creative Tasks](https://medium.com/khan-academy-early-product-development/mastery-learning-and-creative-tasks-97c4a11f8364 "Mastery Learning and Creative Tasks")

Khan Academy’s Andy Matuschak on tasks that require “depth of knowledge” versus those that have higher “transfer demand.” Both can be considered “difficult” in a sense, but teaching techniques to build knowledge need different approaches:

> One big implication of mastery learning is that students should have as much opportunity to practice a skill as they’d like. Unlike a class that moves at a fixed pace, a struggling student should always be able to revisit prerequisites, read an alternative explanation, and try some new challenges. These systems usually consider a student to have finally “mastered” a skill when they can consistently answer related problems over an extended period of time.

It’s not every day you see the map changing:

> Burundi is moving its capital from the shores of Lake Tanganyika and deep into the nation’s central highlands.
> 
> Authorities announced they would change the political capital from Bujumbura to Gitega, which is located over 100 kilometers (62 miles) to the east.
