Tyler Cowen is hopeful (as am I), but skeptical:

> I have two major worries.Â  First, if Milei approaches fiscal success, the opposing parties will think long and hard about whether they wish to enable further success.Â  Or will they instead prefer to see the Milei reforms crash and burn for fiscal reasons?Â  I donâ€™t think they know themselves, but the history of politics in Argentina does not give special reason to be super-optimistic here.Â  You donâ€™t have to believe the opposition will deliberately flush their country down the toilet, they just not might be convinced that further fiscal consolidation is needed, even if it is (surely they gotten this wrong a lot in the past).

For a country to swing so wildly from state-run strangulation to an quasi-populist libertarian economist makes me worried his effect on Argentine bureaucracy will fade in the next 12 months.

But his Davos talk was phenomenal. Should be shown in high school classrooms.
