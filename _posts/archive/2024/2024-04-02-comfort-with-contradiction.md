From my [latest issue](https://www.resextensa.co/p/comfort-with-contradiction "Comfort with Contradiction") of Res Extensa:

> One of the most important things we can teach our children as they're coming of age is to cultivate a comfort with contradiction. Sometimes good things come at the expense of other good things. You can’t always get your way. There’s no such thing as a free lunch.
>
> As we grow up, we discover the contradictions of everyday life: one benefit requires giving up another.
> 
> In fact, we do teach these things as parents trying to raise well-adjusted kids: Share and help others. Tell the truth, even when there’s a benefit to not doing so. Delay gratification. What’s great for you might not be great for the group. These are all ways of preparing a human for participation in a polite, but complicated, society.

Thinking we can avoid grappling with the inevitable contradictions of everyday life lead us to bad places:

> Utopian ideas of the future require one to think in radical terms, and to lose hard-won progress. Radicals want to ignore trade-offs, to start over, to rebuild, to avoid the contradiction in the first place rather than grapple with it, ignoring [Chesterton’s fences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton#Chesterton's_fence "Chesterton's fence"). If anything, school these days fosters more of this kind of radical thinking than its opposite.
> 
> The irony is that a discomfort with contradiction doesn’t get rid of it anyway. Just because we shouldn’t have to live with imperfections doesn't cause a bulldozed, greenfield solution to actually work. We often end up tearing things down and still have the same negative outcome we had before. It's George Orwell's "[Where's the omelet?](https://www.afr.com/opinion/museum-of-dead-utopianism-20161130-gt0ppj "Where's the omelet?")" every time.

I first heard this idea [from Jonah Goldberg](https://www.nationalreview.com/g-file/conservatism-definition-difficult-produce/ "Definition of Conservatism"), and it's been bubbling around in my head ever since.
