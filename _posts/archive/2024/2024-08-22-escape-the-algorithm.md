In this latest issue of _Res Extensa_, I wrote about the need to escape from the passive consumption trap. We wake up, pick up the phone, and wait for
algorithms to tell us what to read, watch, and listen to. Our attention is captured by things we didn't even decide to give it to.

I'm making a conscious effort to return to engaged, active consumption as much as possible. Appreciating. Carefully reading and listening. Choosing specifically what I want to give my attention to.
