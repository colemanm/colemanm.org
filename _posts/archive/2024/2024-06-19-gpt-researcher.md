> GPT Researcher is an autonomous agent designed for comprehensive online research on a variety of tasks.
>
> The agent can produce detailed, factual and unbiased research reports, with customization options for focusing on relevant resources, outlines, and lessons. Inspired by the recent Plan-and-Solve and RAG papers, GPT Researcher addresses issues of speed, determinism and reliability, offering a more stable performance and increased speed through parallelized agent work, as opposed to synchronous operations.

I've been tinkering around with this tool for doing deeper topic research. It uses the ChatGPT API and GPT-4o to conduct multi-phase agent-based
research. Adds sources, citations, and can be directed with specific tuning. Very interesting.
