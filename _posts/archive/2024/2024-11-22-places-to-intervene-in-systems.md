Gordon Brander explores Meadows's list of intervention points in systems, from her excellent book *[Thinking in Systems](/books/meadows-thinking-in-systems "Thinking in Systems by Donella Meadows")*:

> All systems are fictions that we project onto our environment for our own instrumental purposes. Those purposes are determined by our mindset, by the way we see the world around us.
>
> If the pursuit of our instrumental goals results in catastrophe, perhaps it is possible to change our mindset, the mindset or paradigm out of which the system — its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters — arises?

Her list is a useful set of reminders for how we can modify complex systems to tilt them toward desired goals.
