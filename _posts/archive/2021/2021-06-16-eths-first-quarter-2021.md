James Wang looks at the state of Ethereum as if it was a software company. If it was a business hosting an earnings call each quarter, what would we think of its financial and performance metrics?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ethereum isn&#39;t just a crypto currency. It&#39;s a software platform with users, revenue, and applications.<br><br>If you cover software like AWS, MSFT, SNOW, or TWLO you should cover Ethereum ($ETH). To get started, check out its Q1 &#39;earnings&#39; results:<a href="https://t.co/8ZrEkQRFke">https://t.co/8ZrEkQRFke</a></p>&mdash; James Wang (@draecomino) <a href="https://twitter.com/draecomino/status/1394296083384348676?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 17, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

2020 was a banner year so far for the platform. Some choice stats, emphasis mine:

- _Transaction volume_
  - Decentralized exchange (DEX) volumeÂ **increased 76x to $177 billion in Q1 2021, compared with $2.3 billion in Q1 2020**.
  - Decentralized Finance (DeFi) total value lockedÂ **increased 64x to 52 billion in Q1 2021, compared with $0.8 billion in Q1 2020**.
- _Ecosystem_
  - **[Metamask](https://metamask.io/ "Metamask") â€” the popular Ethereum wallet for desktop and mobileâ€”reached 4 million monthly active users (MAUs) in Q1 and crossed 5 million MAUs in April**. Metamask mobile saw strong global growth, especially in India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Nigeria.Â **Metamaskâ€™s MAUs is now comparable to mainstream consumer applications such as Robinhood and Clubhouse.**
  - **VisaÂ announced that it now settles payments in the USDC stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain.** This makes Visa the first major payments network to use stablecoin as a settlement currency.

Before "ETH-pilling" myself a couple months ago, I had been boxing Ethereum simplistically in with Bitcoin as "another cryptocurrency". But once down the rabbit hole, you realize that the only similarity between ETH and BTC is blockchain. What's _built on top of_ each's blockchain is wildly different. Bitcoin has largely found its home as "digital gold", solving the store-of-value problem in a hardened, digital way.

Ethereum is different. It helped me to think of it as a distributed and decentralized "global computer" â€” a secure hive-mind on top of which you can build entire applications using its [native programming language](https://docs.soliditylang.org/ "Solidity"). More than Bitcoin, it's a store-of-value, smart contract platform, and financial infrastructure for the internet age. Ether, it's currency, is the coin of the realm to do stuff on the Ethereum network.

The more I read and invest, the more exciting it gets. Ethereum creates a network for trustless interaction between people and organizations, buyers and sellers, creators and consumers, native to the internet.

Until now we've had to make do with meatspace-based infrastructure for most of our interactions with one another via the internet. Now we have a burgeoning ecosystem for a true [web3](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/ "Web 2 vs. Web 3").
