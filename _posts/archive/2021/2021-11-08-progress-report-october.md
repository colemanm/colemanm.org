I'm going take a stab at rebooting the monthly progress posts I used to do back when I was diligently tracking several goals through 2019 and 2020. Each month I'd look at how I was tracking against plan for fixed targets like "run 650 miles".

This time we're gonna try something different. I'll include my workout activities, because I still want to note my monthly quantities even if not tracking against a fixed number, books I'm reading, and other media I've been consuming, inspired by Julian Lehr's regular "[media consumption](https://julian.digital/2021/05/03/media-consumption-apr-2021/ "Media Consumption")" updates.

October was a pretty normal month. The only notable differences from standard pattern of life were my first airline flight since the start of the pandemic (to DC for a company event) and I capped off the month with a visit to the Mayo Clinic for my regular cancer screening scans (MRIs and CTs — all clear!). Ending a month with good news is always energizing for the next one.

## Health

### Running

Since the summer started I got into a more regular cadence than I had earlier in the year. The move really did a number on my habit patterns, not in a good way for exercise. But now I'm back to it more or less, with better mileage each week.

| Activities | Miles | Time  | Calories | Avg HR | Avg Pace |
|------------|-------|-------|----------|--------|----------|
| 7          | 28.06 | 4h 9m | 3080     | 156    | 8:57/mi  |

The last week with traveling was a bust, but this is much better than my February/March performance.

### Sleep & Screen Time

I've been tracking my daily screen time and sleep data all year, which I'll write up a post on sometime soon. Here were the numbers for October.

(Guess which week we got the puppy...)

* **Sleep**: 6.88 average hours per night
* **Screen Time**: 5 hours 6 minutes per day
