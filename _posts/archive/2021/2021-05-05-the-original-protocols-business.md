This was the first episode I've listened to of Patrick O'Shaughnessy's new podcast "Business Breakdowns". He and [Alex Rampell](https://twitter.com/arampell "@arampell on Twitter") dive deep on the history of Visa and its unique business model. Alex saw Visa's business first-hand after his company TrialPay was acquired in 2015.

So much good background here on how it started as a local credit card program in Fresno and evolved into the network backbone between banks.

They also mentioned a book on the history of the credit card (and other financial innovations of the same era) called _[A Piece of the Action](https://amzn.to/3eW44Oh "A Piece of the Action")_, which sounds super interesting.
