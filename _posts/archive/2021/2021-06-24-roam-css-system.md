For the last few months I've been using [Alexander Rink](https://twitter.com/rcvd_io/ "Alexander Rink on Twitter")'s [Roam CSS system](https://alexanderrink.medium.com/the-roam-css-system-cefdf4917051 "The Roam CSS System"), which he's recently released out of beta. The Quattro theme he's developed is excellent, a look that models the [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer "iA Writer") app for macOS.

This system has a documented library of variables you can customize. I went in and made a few tweaks to mine for some colors and highlights here and there, but the base is awesome.

Roam theming is pretty easy to set up. I've got a number of themes set up that I can toggle between.
