I refreshed myself this evening on Bret Victor’s amazing talk from 2012, “Inventing on Principle.”

He’s been working on and promoting his ideas on interactive, responsive tools for creativity are still ahead of their time.

Check out his current work at [Dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/ “Dynamicland”), a research group working on new interactive tools.
