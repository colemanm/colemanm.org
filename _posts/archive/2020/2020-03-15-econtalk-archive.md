If you're holed up in quarantine and have some extra time, Russ Roberts's website has a nice browsable list of all the EconTalk episodes in the archives. So many timeless interviews in here, which is unique for podcasts, many of which are timely and outdated after a couple of years.

Some of my favorites from last year:

* [Rory Sutherland on Alchemy](https://www.econtalk.org/rory-sutherland-on-alchemy/ "Rory Sutherland on Alchemy")
* [Patrick Collison on Innovation and Scientific Progress](https://www.econtalk.org/patrick-collison-on-innovation-and-scientific-progress/ "Patrick Collison on Innovation and Scientific Progress")
* [David Deppner on Leadership, Confidence, and Humility](https://www.econtalk.org/david-deppner-on-leadership-confidence-and-humility/ "David Deppner on Leadership, Confidence, and Humility")
* [Venkatesh Rao on Waldenponding](https://www.econtalk.org/venkatesh-rao-on-waldenponding/ "Venkatesh Rao on Waldenponding")
