Ben Thompson's [Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/ "Stratechery") is one of the must-read newsletters out there. I've been a subscriber and avid reader for 4 years now, and I think I've read every post he's published since then. Lately I'm finding I get behind on keeping up with his pace of output on the members-only Daily Update feed. So it was exciting to see the launch of this new channel where he's creating a podcast version of the Daily Update for subscribers.

For the past week I've been listening to the posts rather than reading, which has made it much easier to content with the inbox flow. Even though there are typically diagrams and charts in his posts, he's embedding those as chapter art inside the podcast episodes, so you still even have access to the visual aids while listening.

This is a great addition to an already-valuable subscription to Stratechery. It'd be great to see other content producers experiment like this with alternative formats to make their material more widely accessible.
