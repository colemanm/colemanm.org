Basecamp's [Ryan Singer](https://twitter.com/rjs "Ryan Singer") has been doing this solo podcast on a lot of his favored topics, centered around product design. But he also branches into adjacent, related areas of systems, research, user experiences, and more.

I like the solo format as a different approach to your standard conversation or interview shows. I've listened to a couple of these, and the best way to describe the content is somewhere between a Twitter thread and a blog post series. You get the good parts about the Twitter medium — the sort of unstructured, "thinking out loud" quality — with more space and freedom to wander between topics.
