### 🕰 [Timeful Texts](https://numinous.productions/timeful/ "Timeful Texts")

A new piece from [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/) and [Michael Nielsen](http://michaelnielsen.org/) (beautifully illustrated by [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/)). Can we make reading a more engaging and interactive learning experience? This builds on previous ideas from the authors on spaced repetition.

### 🤼‍♂️ [Software, Full-Stack, and Sumo Startups](https://diff.substack.com/p/software-full-stack-and-sumo-startups "Software, Full-Stack, and Sumo Startups")

Interesting take from one of Byrne Hobart's recent newsletters. Contrasting a typical "full-stack" model of company-building and VC funding to a "sumo" model:

> The amount of VC funding has been rising steadily, and returns are skewed by a few positive outliers, so any fund that doesn’t have a specific size mandate is actively looking for companies that can absorb a _lot_ of capital as they grow. The best way to get more capital is to move from a capital-efficient business to a capital-inefficient one, so there’s a strong incentive to pivot in this direction.
>
> The incentive is sometimes _too_ strong. Some companies go beyond the “full-stack” model to what I think of as the “sumo” model: raising an intimidating amount of money just to scare off everyone else. The sumo model does prevent one failure mode for startups: the situation where every time Company A raises a round, it validates the model and lets Company B raise more, which forces Company A to burn through their marketing budget faster and raise an even bigger round, and so on until the entire space is over-capitalized and everyone’s assumptions about long-term unit economics are implausibly optimistic. It’s an easier strategy to try when capital is abundant, but it’s a harder strategy to pull off; the bar for “an absurd amount to invest in a company that just does X” keeps going up.

In the arena of geeky digital marketing, this is a great deconstruction of organic optimization tactics in play at Canva, one of the best out there at enabling discovery through search and backlink traffic. I love how thoughtful and intentional their page architecture is; it enables so much adaptive targeting to sweep up long-tail keyword spaces.
