This conversation with [Jos√© Luis Ric√≥n Fern√°ndez de la Puente](https://twitter.com/ArtirKel "Jose Luis Ricon on Twitter") on [Erik Torenberg's podcast](https://www.villageglobal.vc/podcast/ "Venture Stories") was an expansive cover of more topics than I think I've ever heard discussed on a single podcast. A brief sampling of the subjects touched: scientific progress, economics, GDP growth, health care, regulations, longevity research.

Also see [Jos√©'s blog](https://nintil.com/ "Nintil") for more in-depth coverage on his research topics.
