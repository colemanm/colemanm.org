This was a fascinating interview with Dr. Michele Gelfand from Jonah Goldberg's _The Remnant_ podcast. It mostly covers the subject of her book _[Rule Makers, Rule Breakers](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/39939300 "Rule Makers, Rule Breakers")_, on the differences between "tight" vs. "loose" cultures — think Singapore or China vs. Spain or Italy. It's a timely subject in this time of global response to a pandemic, seeing how different cultures respond to the crisis.
