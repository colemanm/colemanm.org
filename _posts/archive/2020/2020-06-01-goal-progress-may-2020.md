Just a quick update this month. With the pandemic still going, lockdown in a state of unknown non-committal from any authority, and the madness going on around the nation the past week, all of this seems kinda trivial. I'm sure we'll power through past it, but I'm just doing my best to keep the habits going. I'm still fortunate to get to plow forward mostly unimpacted by it all.

| Activity       | Progress      | Pace         | Goal         | Plus-Minus                       |
|----------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **Running**    | 257.89 miles  | 272 miles    | 650 miles    | <span class="red">-14.58</span>  |
| **Meditation** | 1070 minutes  | 1308 minutes | 3120 minutes | <span class="">â€”</span>          |
| **Reading**    | 13 books      | 12.58 books  | 30 books     | <span class="green">+0.42</span> |

I've been reading some great books lately. No particular update this time on that front, but _[From Dawn to Decadence](/books/barzun-from-dawn-to-decadence/ "From Dawn to Decadence")_ is fantastic, I just started Matt Ridley's _[How Innovation Works](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45449488-how-innovation-works "How Innovation Works")_, and _[Ra](/books/qntm-ra/ "Ra")_ is one of the most interesting fiction works I've read.

Meditation hasn't gotten folded back into the routine yet. I'm going to leave the goal in my updates and plan to get back to it and catch up by year end.
