There are so many good little pieces in this brief interview with [Alicia Juarrero](https://aliciajuarrerodotcom1.wordpress.com/ "Alicia Juarrero"), who studies complex systems and complexity theory.

> Three options are possible once a complex system reaches a threshold of instability: adaptation, evolution, or disintegration. There is never a guarantee that the whole will not collapse, which it will do if we are unable to adapt and evolve to achieve a new coherence or fit. I think of _adaptation_ as modifications within a given space of possibilities. You either expand your adaptive capacity or move to a more stable location within that adaptive space.
