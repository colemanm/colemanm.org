Internal memos are insightful resources to look at how organizations work and make decisions.
Bessemer has published [an archive](https://www.bvp.com/memos "BVP Memos") of the investment memos that their partners have written to their internal investment committees. A few neat ones:

* [Shopify Series A](https://www.bvp.com/memos/shopify "Shopify Memo"), 2010
* [SendGrid Series B](https://www.bvp.com/memos/sendgrid "SendGrid Memo"), 2011
* [Twilio Seed](https://www.bvp.com/memos/twilio "Twilio Memo"), 2009
