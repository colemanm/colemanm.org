I don't know what Lex Fridman is doing to recruit the guests he gets on his show ([The Artificial Intelligence Podcast](https://lexfridman.com/ai/ "The Artificial Intelligence Podcast")), but it's one of the best technical podcasts out there.

This one is a good introduction to the work of legendary psychologist Daniel Kahneman (of _[Thinking, Fast and Slow](/books/kahneman-thinking-fast-and-slow/ "Thinking, Fast and Slow")_ fame).
