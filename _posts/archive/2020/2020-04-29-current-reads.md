I recently added to my [Library](/books/ "Books") section to include the books I'm currently reading. At the top of the page now I'll be including books in the rotation. You'll notice that I'm always reading multiple things at once. Usually the batch is either a) modal: I've got something on Audible, a paper book, maybe a couple e-books, or b) type: nonfiction, fiction, etc.

Currently in progress:

* **_[From Dawn to Decadence](/books/barzun-from-dawn-to-decadence/ "From Dawn to Decadence")_**, Jacques Barzun. 2000.
* **_[Ra](/books/hughes-ra/ "Ra")_**, Sam Hughes. 2014
* **_[How to Take Smart Notes](/books/ahrens-how-to-take-smart-notes/ "How to Take Smart Notes")_**, Sönke Ahrens. 2017.
