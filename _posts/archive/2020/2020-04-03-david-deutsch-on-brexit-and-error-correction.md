I ran across this interview with physicist [David Deutsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Deutsch "David Deutsch"), with his thoughts on Brexit. A lot of great stuff here on resilience, error correction, individualism vs. collectivism, Karl Popper, and Britain's [first-past-the-post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting "First-past-the-post") system.
