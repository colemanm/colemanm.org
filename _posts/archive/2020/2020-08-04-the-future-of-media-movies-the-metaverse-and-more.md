An interview with media and gaming industry analyst Matthew Ball.

Make sure to listen to his thoughts on metaverses (around the 34:00 mark). The section on Epic Games and the future trajectory they're putting themselves on is incredible.

Make sure to also check out his ["epic" series on Epic Games](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/epicgamesprimermaster "The Epic Games Primer").
