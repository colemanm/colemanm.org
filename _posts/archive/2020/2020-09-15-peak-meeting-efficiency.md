An epic post from Steven Sinofsky about all forms of meetings, when to use them, when not to use them. The list of dysfunctions and countering tactics is full of gems.

> The thing is that most people say they don’t want to have meetings. Most say “oh that meeting could have been handled with an email or slack message”. They might be right. But that is only if you take the meeting literally. Meetings mean so much more to a company than conveying information or deciding.

>Meetings are literally how cultures are formed, values expressed, and companies made.
