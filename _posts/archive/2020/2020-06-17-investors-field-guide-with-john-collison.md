I enjoyed this interview with Stripe co-founder [John Collison](https://twitter.com/collision "John Collison on Twitter"). The range of topics covered in this discussion is wild. Always impressive to see someone that's been so objectively successful still maintain the level of curiosity he does, motivated to constantly fill knowledge gaps.

A sampling of the discussion topics:

* Industrial conglomerates
* Value of writing skill and clear internal communication
* Size vs. speed in companies
* Shared playbooks from SV
* How GAAP practices should evolve
