The roamcult has been on a streak of creating tools to extend and improve Roam Research. Here are a few that I've been using lately.

**[Better Roam Research](https://fabriziorinaldi.com/better-roam-research/ "Better Roam Research")**

This one is a simple Chrome extension that reskins Roam with a minimalist design. It doesn't change much about the utilitarian interface, just some simple spacing and colors (plus Dark Mode support).

**[+Roam](https://nesslabs.com/roam-research-bookmarklet "+Roam")**

A simple Chrome extension for clipping quotes into your Roam database. It takes the snippet and source URL and formats them into a nice block to link into your notes.

**[Roam Toolkit](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/roam-toolkit/ebckolanhdjilblnkcgcgifaikppnhba "Roam Toolkit")**

A toolbox of useful utilities to make Roam better — `FuzzyDate` is a quicker way to enter date links, spaced repetition tools for memory, custom CSS, custom shortcuts.

**[Roam Codes](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/First_try/page/PzVw9HufT "Roam Codes")**

This isn't really a tool, but this documentation page shows the extensive set of special codes and objects you can use in Roam markup.
