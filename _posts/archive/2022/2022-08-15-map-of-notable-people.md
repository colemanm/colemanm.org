One of the neatest data visualization projects I've seen lately is [Topi Tjukanov](https://twitter.com/tjukanov "Topi Tjukanov on Twitter")'s "[Map of Notable People](https://tjukanovt.github.io/notable-people "Map of Notable People")." It takes a database of birthplaces of notable people and maps them to cities on a global interactive map. Surprisingly addictive to pan around.
