Just this afternoon I finished up another round of scans at Mayo Clinic — my standard regimen of an hour-long MRI of the abdomen and a CT scan of the chest / lungs. Everything went routine and the worry level leading up to it the past couple weeks was as low as its ever been. So that's a victory.

I was thinking about how many times I've actually gone through this process and I've lost count. I think it must be around 12 times now, with how often I had to get them done during the first couple years after treatment. I'm sure it'll be a lifelong procedural activity, so it's good to make it a routine and get used to it.
