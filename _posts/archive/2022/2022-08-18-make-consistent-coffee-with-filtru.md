I've gotten back into brewing coffee lately. I used to be an avid [Aeropress](https://aeropress.com/ "Aeropress") user, and I also use a [Chemex](https://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/ "Chemex") or French press occasionally, so I got them back out to use instead of relying on my lower quality (more expensive), lazier Nespresso setup.

I had my own trial-and-error based methodology for brewing with these tools. My best brews happened with the Aeropress. But I went down a research rabbit hole to look at the best techniques for using them.

In searching for a brew timer for my phone, I found this app called [Filtru](https://getfiltru.com/ "Filtru"). It's a super slick, well-made timer app that guides you through each stage of brewing with your equipment of choice. Highly recommended.
