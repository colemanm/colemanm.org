The community around [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion "Stable Diffusion on GitHub"), the open source AI project for text-to-image generation, has been buzzing. From nonexistent a year ago to thousands of contributors and forks and spinoffs. There's even a [GUI macOS app](https://github.com/divamgupta/diffusionbee-stable-diffusion-ui "DiffusionBee on GitHub").  

[Lexica](https://lexica.art/ "Lexica") is a project to index and make prompts and images from Stable Diffusion searchable. Playing around with it, it's pretty impressive. So much incredible possibility here. This tech will make the volume of content on the internet literally infinite.
