Jason Lemkin with some interesting takeaways from Palantir's performance over the recent years. A couple of highlights:

> #2. **Its Top 20 Customers pay an average a stunning $45m a year (!).**  And thatâ€™s 24% higher than a year ago!
>
> #4. **Yes, Palantir is Solidly a Software Company.** Gross Margins remain well above 80%.  It was perhaps fair to criticize Palantir as a services business in large part in the run up to the IPO â€” but no longer.  With many quarters of 80%+ gross margins, thatâ€™s software.

The net retention they've demonstrated is bananas: 120%+ consistently since going public in 2020. And $2B ARR. Still an enigmatic and unique business, and the expanding diversification into commercial is something a lot of people thought wouldn't happen.
