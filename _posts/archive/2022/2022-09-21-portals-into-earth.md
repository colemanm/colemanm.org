From John McPhee's *[Annals of the Former World](/post/annals-of-the-former-world/ "Annals of the Former World")*:

> Geologists on the whole are inconsistent drivers. When a roadcut presents itself, they tend to lurch and weave. To them, the roadcut is a portal, a fragment of a regional story, a proscenium arch that leads their imaginations into the earth and through the surrounding terrane.

This is a book I'd love to revisit. So many great bits of history.
