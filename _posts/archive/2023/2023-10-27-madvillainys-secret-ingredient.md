Brandon from _Digging the Greats_ breaks down Madlib and MF DOOM's epic collaboration:

{% include video.html id="dHtuoKqSif0" %}

I remember in [this extended interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGu0ao_rdAk) with MF DOOM him talking about the lackadaisical approach to making the record. Madlib would make a beat upstairs, give it to DOOM, and he'd spend time separately writing and recording vocals. Slowly and gradually building up a catalog of ridiculously inventive music.
