Stewart Brand's _Whole Earth Catalog_ was a counterculture magazine from the 1970s. Ostensibly it was about DIY and self-sufficiency, with a focus on product reviews, but flip through an issue and there's almost no subject you won't find. It reflected the publisher's holistic, systems philosophy.

The [Whole Earth Index](https://wholeearth.info/ "Whole Earth Index") is an archive of Whole Earth as downloadable PDFs, hosted by the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/ "archive.org").

> Here lies a nearly-complete archive of Whole Earth publications, a series of journals and magazines descended from the Whole Earth Catalog, published by Stewart Brand and the POINT Foundation between 1970 and 2002. They are made available here for scholarship, education, and research purposes.

Today's version of the WEC I suppose is the zeitgeist conversation of anon accounts on Twitter. But there's something special about an eclectic, visual, curated guide to a world of interesting things.
