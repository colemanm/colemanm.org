Jason Fried has an idea for improving education that I couldn't agree with more — teaching kids how to iterate:

> Making anything better is iteration. When you put something out there, it’ll often land right back in your lap. Sometimes that feedback boomerangs back directly, other times you have to infer the problems by deciphering other people’s behavior when they interact with the thing you gave them. This customer struggled with this, this manufacturing tolerance didn’t line up with that, this printing process looked better on the screen than it did on paper. Or after a certain amount of time passes while working on something, you reflect on what you’ve done and don’t like the reflection.

The idea that work is done and thrown over the fence and never touched again is the exception, not the norm. Like Jason said: in professional life, iteration, improvement, and ongoing projects are the default.

Plus the way you approach building things will be different if you start knowing iteration is part of the game. You'll take more risks and try more things when you know at the beginning that you'll get a chance to refine.
