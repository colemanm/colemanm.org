This paper describes an experiment to merge freeform document-style text and structured computations into a single interface.

  > We think a promising workflow is *gradual enrichment* from docs to apps: starting with regular text documents and incrementally evolving them into interactive software. In this essay, we present a research prototype called Potluck that supports this workflow. Users can create *live searches* that extract structured information from freeform text, write formulas that compute with that information, and then display the results as *dynamic annotations* in the original document.

The idea is to prioritize the open-endedness of documents with the benefits of some schema, to enable computations and structure. Documents are powerful for their flexibility to accommodate all kinds of information, but the trade-off is a static environment, whereas applications can be dynamic and responsive. Potluck gives a look at what happens when you get some of both worlds.

Try out some of [the examples](https://www.inkandswitch.com/potluck/demo/?openDocument=aeropress "Potluck examples"). It's impressive and shows promise for the future of the low-code / build-your-own-software movement.
