I'm an occasional listener to Peter Attia's podcast _[The Drive](https://peterattiamd.com/podcast/ "The Peter Attia Drive")_. The deep dives on some areas of medicine and health are interesting to me, but a lot of it is just too in-the-weeds.

This conversation from _Invest Like the Best_ was fantastic. Peter recently published _[Outlive](https://amzn.to/3N41IPX "Outlive by Peter Attia")_, a book resulting from his learnings in longevity science.

Longevity is a popular subject over the last 5 years, especially in tech circles. Peter has always put an interesting spin on the concept that I think is actually more attractive than purely thinking about living to 125. His notion of "healthspan" I think is the right place for most of us to focus. Rather than trying to live well past 100, what if we could maintain a high level of health, mobility, and function from 75 to 100? Longevity research on its own doesn't index for healthspan, just age. I think most of us want to be able to play outside with our grandkids (even great grandkids!) without having to be confined to a chair.
