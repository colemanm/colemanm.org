From [an interview](https://hbr.org/2017/01/lifes-work-jerry-seinfeld "Life’s Work: An Interview with Jerry Seinfeld") with Jerry Seinfeld at HBR:

> **HBR: You and Larry David wrote Seinfeld together, without a traditional writers’ room, and burnout was one reason you stopped. Was there a more sustainable way to do it? Could McKinsey or someone have helped you find a better model?**
> 
> Jerry: Who’s McKinsey?
> 
> **HBR: It’s a consulting firm.**
> 
> Jerry: Are they funny?
> 
> **HBR: No.**
> 
> Jerry: Then I don’t need them. If you’re efficient, you’re doing it the wrong way. The right way is the hard way. The show was successful because I micromanaged it—every word, every line, every take, every edit, every casting. That’s my way of life.

We should all ask ourselves fundamental questions like this more often. First principles, and whatnot.
