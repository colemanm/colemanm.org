I'm late getting my November update posted. November (and still, in December) was a rollercoaster of a month. Just so much happening with professional and personal, I've hardly had a moment to do much at all — neither focusing on any personal progress goals, nor writing or other fun side deals.

My running performance was pitiful. I did 5 runs, but honestly I'm surprised it was even that many. Feels like I'm totally off the wagon on that. I did alright on my sleep, but I swing too much back and forth to be a healthy pattern. I'll do a string of 5-6 hour sleep nights, punctuated by sleeping 10 hours the next. The see-saw effect isn't intentional. Something I need to focus more on building a pattern with.

Public writing didn't do great, only a few blogs before I fell off and didn't get any more writing done. I did better on the personal journal, though. At least for the first half the month.

Reading also suffered some. I feel like I didn't spend any time with a book at all.
