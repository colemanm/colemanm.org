###  [The Use of Knowledge in Society](https://www.kysq.org/docs/Hayek_45.pdf "The Use of Knowledge in Society")

I've been reading some of Hayek's famous articles this week. This one is all about what he probably considered one of the most important concepts, since these basic ideas form a central thesis for most of his works. His argument was for bottoms-up, decentralized systems of decision-making instead of centralized, top-down systems:

> The peculiar character of the problem of a rational economic order is determined precisely by the fact that the knowledge of the circumstances of which we must make use never exists in concentrated or integrated form but solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge which all the separate individuals possess. The economic problem of society is thus not merely a problem of how to allocate “given” resources—if “given” is taken to mean given to a single mind which deliberately solves the problem set by these “data.” It is rather a problem of how to secure the best use of resources known to any of the members of society, for ends whose relative importance only these individuals know. Or, to put it briefly, it is a problem of the utilization of knowledge which is not given to anyone in its totality.

This short film of drone footage showcases the amazing, almost-alien, landscapes of Iceland. This guy's channel has a lot of interesting quick films like this.

A fuzzy finder for the command line. Just install it from Homebrew with `brew install fzf` and improve your file searching on the shell. No more having to remember `find` command syntax.
