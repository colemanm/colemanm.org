Jason Carman's _S3_ project has been relaunched (no pun intended) as [The Story Company](https://www.story.inc/ "The Story Company"), continuing his incredible work on documenting the hard tech scene.

At the start of the year they published their first feature documentary, _New Space_. A story about the current state of the space industry, and what's different this time in the marriage between government-backed and private spaceflight.
