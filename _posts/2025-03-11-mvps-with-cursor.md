Good stuff [here](https://x.com/prajwaltomar_/status/1895839765280539068/?rw_tt_thread=True) on building with [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/). Some takeaways:

- Use [starter kits](https://www.codeguide.dev/) to bootstrap project directories
- Build assistive docs to help the Agent. Remember that the Agent behaves a lot like a human:
	- A human with minimal guidance doesn't infer the right choices
	- PRDs, app flows, tech stacks / API docs, frontend/backend guidelines all help it do what you want
- project rules over .cursorrules
	- More flexible
	- Sync across teams
	- Fine-tune based on tech stack

I've had much better results getting in the weeds with PRDs well before having agents go off and build. And you can have multiple AIs work on and
refine your documents, too.
