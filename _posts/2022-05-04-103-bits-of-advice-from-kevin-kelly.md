A list of observations and life tips from Wired's [Kevin Kelly](https://twitter.com/kevin2kelly "Kevin Kelly on Twitter"). This entire list is self-highlighting. Fantastic stuff. Worth bookmarking and reading back through monthly.

A few favorites:

> * No one is as impressed with your possessions as you are.
> * Anything you say before the word "but" does not count.
> * When you forgive others, they may not notice, but you will heal. Forgiveness is not something we do for others; it is a gift to ourselves.
> * Efficiency is highly overrated; Goofing off is highly underrated. Regularly scheduled sabbaths, sabbaticals, vacations, breaks, aimless walks and time off are essential for top performance of any kind. The best work ethic requires a good rest ethic.
> * Productivity is often a distraction. Donâ€™t aim for better ways to get through your tasks as quickly as possible, rather aim for better tasks that you never want to stop doing.
> * There is no such thing as being "on time." You are either late or you are early. Your choice.
> * Half the skill of being educated is learning what you can ignore.
> * You can be whatever you want, so be the person who ends meetings early.
