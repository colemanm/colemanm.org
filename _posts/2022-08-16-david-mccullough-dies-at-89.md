Historian David McCullough died last week at age 89. If you've never read his work, it's some of the best, most readable and engaging history you can find. I've read a few of his books over the years, like _The Great Bridge_ (about the building of the Brooklyn Bridge), _[1776](/books/mccullough-1776/ "1776 by David McCullough")_ (the Revolutionary War), and his biography _John Adams_. Looking back on his bibliography, all of his others are on my reading list.

It's always unfortunate to lose such a critical voice in American culture, but at least his books will stand the test of time and be read by generations.

Here's [a quote](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/99-03-02-3755 "From John Adams to Caroline Amelia Smith De Windt, 24 January 1820") from John Adams, pulled from McCullough's biography, with which he clearly resonated:

> "The longer I live, the more I read, the more patiently I think and the more anxiously I inquire, the less I seem to know. Do justly. Love mercy. Walk humbly. This is enough."
