[Oblique Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies "Oblique Strategies") was originally a set of cards created by Brian Eno and
Peter Schmidt back in 1975. Each card contains effectively a single prompt intended to help get you unstuck creatively. Prompts like:

- Use an old idea.
- State the problem in words as clearly as possible.
- Only one element of each kind.
- What would your closest friend do?
- What to increase? What to reduce?

This site is an online version, each refresh showing a new random card. Interesting.
