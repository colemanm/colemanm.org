What a great line from Oliver Wendell Holmes.

When you think you're coming up with "simple" responses to complex problems, make sure you're not (as [Bob Moesta says](https://businessofsoftware.org/2019/12/5-skills-innovator-bob-moesta-rewired-group-bos-usa-2018/ "Bob Moesta @ Business of Software")) creating "simplicity on the wrong side of the complexity."

What we really want is to work through all the tangled complexity ourselves as we're picking apart the problem and designing well-fit solutions.

A great (simple) solution to a complex problem can be that way because someone's taken on the burden of detangling the complexity first.
