As of this weekend, Hurricane Ian is in the Caribbean with a projected track that puts it making landfall this week on the western coast of Florida, not far from where we are. Looks like we'll be spending some time getting the house prepared for the storm. Doesn't look like there'll be an evacuation for us.
