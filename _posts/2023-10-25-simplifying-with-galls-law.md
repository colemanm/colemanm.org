In the latest issue of Res Extensa, I [dove into "Gall's Law"](https://www.resextensa.co/p/galls-law-but-first-simplify "Gall's Law: But First, Simplify"), which says:

> **A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.**

Too often I see a team propose a solution to a problem that involves making what we've got _more complicated_. Adding more people, more processes, more tools. "Maybe if we start using Salesforce it'll get better." "Perhaps if we bring in Consultant X they'll help us through."

Muddling through is part of the process of building. Don't get upset about it, just get back to first principles and simplify:

> Like most great mental models, Gall’s Law follows its own logic and keeps it simple. It’s a basic principle that helps filter your approach and ask yourself the question when faced with a complex problem: Is my approach simple enough? Does what we’ve already pieced together work before we add more parts, people, or processes?
