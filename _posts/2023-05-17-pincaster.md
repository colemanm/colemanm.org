If you haven't checked it out, it's worth taking a look at [Farcaster](https://www.farcaster.xyz/ "Farcaster"), a new permissionless protocol for building social networks. Think permissionless Twitter â€”Â a protocol for communities to build their _own_ Twitters. Here's [me on Warpcast](https://warpcast.com/coleman "coleman on Warpcast"), the pillar first app on the protocol.

Developer [Carlos MatallÃ­n](https://warpcast.com/matallo "Carlos Matallin on Warpcast") is building a cool tool for discovering interesting content on the Farcaster. Pincaster currently supports books, where you can see a feed of posts on the network discussing the topic. Interesting idea, built permissionlessly thanks to the Farcaster network model.
