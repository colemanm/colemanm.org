Building products that address long-tail user needs (i.e. the wide variety of infrequent-but-sometimes-painful needs of specific users) requires somehow providing users an open-ended landscape to create a solution. It's the promise of the entire ["low-code" tool space](/post/a-nomenclature-for-low-code-users/ "A Nomenclature for Low-Code Users"). We want to create a playground with appropriate guardrails that lets users discover and build their own solutions. Since the tool-builder can't possibly understand the intricate details of the long-tail of user problems, we want a solution to actually *enable the emergence* of solutions we didn't predict or design for.

In this post, [Kasey Klimes](https://twitter.com/KaseyKlimes "Kasey Klimes on Twitter") compares situations this sort of emergence-friendly design model to approaches like user-centered design:
 
> Design for emergence is open-ended. There’s no room for surprise in high modern or user-centered design, unless the design is exapted for an unintended use (see “Design Exaptation” in the bottom right quadrant of the 2x2 above). Meanwhile, a key characteristic of design for emergence is that the end design may be something that the original designer never imagined. Whereas exaptation may indicate a design failure, this kind of surprise is an indication that the designer has succeeded in nurturing emergence.
>
> Design for emergence is permissionless. It empowers people by way of its constitution even though it can never know what people will do with that power. In contrast to user-centered design, design for emergence invites the user into the design process not only as a subject of study, but as a collaborator with agency and control.

Every product has to consider its floor, ceiling, and walls. Meaning, how easy is it to get going (floor), how advanced can I get with it (ceiling), and what variety of things can I solve with it (walls). The best emergence-designed products have a [low floor, wide walls, and a high ceiling](https://gordonbrander.com/pattern/low-floor-wide-walls-high-ceiling/ "Low Floor, Wide Walls, High Ceiling").
