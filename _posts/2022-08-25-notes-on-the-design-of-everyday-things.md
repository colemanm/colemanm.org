Don Norman's _[The Design of Everyday Things](/books/norman-the-design-of-everyday-things/ "The Design of Everyday Things")_ is essential reading for anyone that creates products. I've been doing a re-read of the most recent edition myself.  

I also ran across [this excellent set of notes](https://elvischidera.com/2022-06-24-design-everyday-things "Notes on the Design of Everyday Things") on the book from Elvis Chidera. A good Cliff's Notes version if you want to get a sense for Norman's main ideas.
