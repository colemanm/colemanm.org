  title: "Rory Sutherland on Alchemy"
---

This is a great conversation from EconTalk with advertising exec Rory Sutherland on his new book _[Alchemy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26210508 "Alchemy")_. He's got interesting ideas on the role of psychology and human emotion when it comes to decision making, markets, choice, and governance. A very entertaining and humorous discussion, as well.
