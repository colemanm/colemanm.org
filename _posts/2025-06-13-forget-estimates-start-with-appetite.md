In the latest issue of Building Blocks, I dove into Shape Up and its idea of setting the appetite for a project.

Fundamentally, appetite inverts the question we begin with when planning a project.

Instead of starting with "Here's a spec. How long will it take?", we start with a time window we're comfortable spending on the problem and ask "What
can we get done inside this box?"

> Rather than define a richly-detailed design of what we want, appetite requires us to start with a problem definition, and refine that first. If we narrow the problem down, we also narrow the solution space. Solutions are allowed to be smaller and more focused.
>
> The appetite starts with time boundary and works backward to a design that fits inside. 
>
>Appetites define sound and acceptable constraints up front. And constraints are wonderful tools for generating creativity.
