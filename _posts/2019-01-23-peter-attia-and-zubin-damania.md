I’ve listened to a few of Peter Attia’s _[The Drive](https://peterattiamd.com/podcast/)_ podcast episodes. This one was a [stand-out conversation](https://peterattiamd.com/podcast/) between him and Dr. Zubin Damania. It’s a wide-ranging discussion about the health care system, diet, creativity, and meditation (among other things).

I’ve spent a lot of time right in the thick of the health care system the last couple of years (thankfully with a good experience). Insightful thoughts on what’s wrong inside that ecosystem that ring true from first-hand exposure.
