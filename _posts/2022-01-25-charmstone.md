I ran across this little Mac utility recently. My left thumb and ring finger are always tethered to the alt-tab keys, muscle memory programmed to toggle between apps routinely on my machine. I must flip through the alt-tab menu _hundreds_ of times in a typical day to switch between apps. If you combine this behavior with having lots of apps open all the time, I'm constantly switching to the wrong things accidentally.

[Charmstone](https://charmstone.app/ "Charmstone") is a clever alternative to alt-tabbing. It uses a combination of key press and mouse movement to pop up a programmable switcher menu from anywhere on the screen. You just hold âŒ¥+âŒ˜ and move your mouse, and a radial selector pops up with icons for your chosen most-used applications. In just a couple days of using it, I'm finding it super handy to getting back to my most-used windows, like Brave, chat apps, and email. No more messy mistaken alt-tab switches getting me confused.
