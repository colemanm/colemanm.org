Byrne Hobart & Tobias Huber:

> Over the past half-century, even leading AI researchers completely failed in their predictions of AGI timelines. So, instead of worrying about sci-fi paperclips or *Terminator* scenarios, we should be more concerned, for example, with all the diseases for which we werenâ€™t able to discover a cure or the scientific breakthroughs that wonâ€™t materialize because weâ€™ve prematurely banned AI research and development based on the improbable scenario of a sentient AI superintelligence annihilating humanity.

A great case for dynamism and progress as our best insulation against regulatory capture, risk, and exploitation.
