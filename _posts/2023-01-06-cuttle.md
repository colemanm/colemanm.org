I recently was getting our Silhouette vinyl cutter back out, since Colette hasn't used it in a while. The software for the thing is still ancient and janky — hard to believe anyone uses it at all.

But I found this new tool for creating vector-based designs for any kind of cutting machine — vinyl printers, CNCs, laser cutters. It looks like an excellent general tool for creating SVGs you can import into all manner of cutting machine proprietary applications.
