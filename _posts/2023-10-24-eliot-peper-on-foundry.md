I love what Eliot Peper does with Substack as a sort of behind-the-scenes look at his writing process. I wish more authors and content creators spent the time to show their workflow. It's incredibly insightful to see the messy process of creativity.

Earlier this year I read _Reap3r_, an excellent technothriller. I just ordered a copy of _Foundry_.
