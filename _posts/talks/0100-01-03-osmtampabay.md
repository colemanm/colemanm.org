At the start of 2012, I started a [meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/osmtampabay/) ([OSM Tampa Bay](http://osmtampabay.org/)) for the local Tampa-St. Petersburg to get together and contribute to OpenStreetMap. This talk was from our first [WhereCampTB](http://wherecamptb.org/) event, to get our local mappers and geographers interesting in joining up.
