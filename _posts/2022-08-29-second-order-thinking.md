Shane Parrish on the power of second-order thinking:  

> **Second-order thinking is more deliberate.** It is thinking in terms of interactions and time, understanding that despite our intentions our interventions [often cause harm](https://fs.blog/2013/10/iatrogenics/ "Iatrogenics"). Second order thinkers ask themselves the question ‚Äú[And then what?](https://fs.blog/2015/12/garrett-hardin-three-filters/ "Three Filters")‚Äù This means thinking about the consequences of repeatedly eating a chocolate bar when you are hungry and using that to inform your decision. If you do this you‚Äôre more likely to eat something healthy.

Those that excel at second- or third-order thinking spend a lot more time running these simulations in their heads, playing out various scenarios and weighing costs/benefits of each unique pathway. It seems like an obvious thing to attempt with any decision; but I see cases regularly where it doesn't appear that a person is playing out their chosen path beyond the next immediate step and likely outcome.  

I'm reminded of the business concept of the "[pre-mortem](https://coda.io/@shreyas/pre-mortems-how-a-stripe-product-manager-predicts-prevents-probl "Pre-Mortems")", wherein a team sits down collectively to look ahead at a decision about to be made or a project about to be tackled, and attempts to *predict* the contents of the post-mortem saying why the project failed or succeeded.
