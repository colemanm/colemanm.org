This is a phenomenal interview with Richard Rhodes, author of the legendary _[The Making of the Atomic Bomb](https://amzn.to/3os6Tj5 "The Making of the Atomic Bomb")_, an expansive history of the Manhattan Project and the development of nuclear weapons technology.

Dwarkesh Shah's show [The Lunar Society](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/ "The Lunar Society") is generally excellent and highly recommended. Just listen to how long he lets Rhodes answer and expound on questions without interruption. These are my favorite types of long-form interviews.
