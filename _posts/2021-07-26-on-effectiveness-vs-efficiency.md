> "Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right things."

People throw around these two words pretty indiscriminately in business, usually not making a distinction between them. They're treated as interchangeable synonyms for broadly being "good" at something.

We can think about effectiveness and efficiency as two dimensions on a grid, often (but not always) in competition with one another. More focus on one means less on the other.

That Drucker quote is a pretty solid one-line distinction. But like many quotes, it's concerned with being pithy and memorable, but not that helpful.

"Doing things right" is too amorphous. I'd define the two dimensions like this:

* **Efficiency** is concerned with being well-run, applying resources with minimal waste; having an economical approach
* ***Effectiveness** is a focus on _fit_, fitting the right solution to the appropriate problem, being specific and surgical in approach

Where would _speed_ fit into this? Many people would think of velocity of work as an aspect of efficiency, but it can also be a consequence of effectiveness. When a team of SEAL operators swoop in to hit a target, we'd say that's just about the pinnacle of being "effective", and swiftness is a key factor in driving that effectiveness.

Let's look at some differences through the lens of product and company-building. What does it mean to orient on one over the other? Which one matters more, and when?

A company is like a machine — you can have an incredibly efficient machine that doesn’t do anything useful, or you can have a machine that does super useful things while wasting a huge amount of energy, money, and time.

One option has our team leaning toward methods and processes that **efficiently** deploy resources:

* Use just the right number of people on a project
* Create infrastructure that's low-cost
* Build supportive environments that get out of peoples' way
* Instrument processes to measure resource consumption
* Spend less on tools along the way

With this sort of focus, a team gets lean, minimizes waste, and creates repeatable systems to build scalable products. Which all sounds great!

On the other dimension, we could apply more attention on **effectiveness**, doing the right things:

* Spend lots of time listening to customers to map out their problems ([demand thinking](https://resextensa.substack.com/p/jobs-theory-thinking-in-demand-and "Jobs Theory: Thinking in Demand and Supply")!)
* Get constant feedback on whether or not what we're making helps customers make progress
* Test small, incremental chunks so we stay close to the problem
* Make deliberate efforts, taking small steps frequently, not going too far down blind alleys with no feedback

Another great-sounding list of things. So what do we do? Clearly there needs to be a balance.

Depending on preferences, personality types, experiences, and skill sets, different people will tend to orient on one of these dimensions more than the other. People have comfort zones they like to operate in. Each stage of product growth requires a different mix of focuses and preferences, and the wrong match will kill your company.

If you’re still in search of the keys to [product-market fit](/post/reaching-the-early-majority/ "Reaching the Early Majority") — hunting for the right problem and the fitting solution — you want your team focused on the demand side. What specific pains do customers have? When do they experience those pains? What things are in our range that can function as solutions? You want to spend time with customers and rapidly probe small problems with incremental solutions, testing validity of your work. That's all that matters. This is Paul Graham's "[do things that don't scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html "Do Things That Don't Scale")" stage. Perfecting your machine's efficiency is wasted effort until you're solving the right problems.

A quick note on speed, and why I think it's _critical_ to being effective — if you’re laser-focused on moving carefully and deliberately to solve the right problem at the right altitude, but not able to move _quickly enough_, you won’t have a tight enough feedback loop to put your solutions on the proving ground to field test them with customers. Essential to the effectiveness measurement problem is the ability to rapidly drive signal back from a user to validate your direction.

When you find the key that unlocks a particular problem-solution pair, _then_ it’s time to consider how efficiently you can [expand it to a wider audience](/post/go-to-market-fit/ "Go-to-Market Fit"). If your hacked-together, duct-taped solution cracks the code and solves problems for customers, you need to address the efficiency with which you can economically expand to others. In my experience in the early to mid-stage, effectiveness is far and away the more important thing to focus on.

The traditional definition of efficiency refers to achieving maximum output with the minimum required effort. When you're still in search of the right solution, the effort:output ratio _barely_ matters. It only matters insofar as you have the required runway to test enough iterations to reach utility for users. Outside of that, there’s no benefit to getting 100 miles/gallon if you’re driving the wrong way.

Getting this balance wrong is easy. There’s a pernicious feature of many engineers working on pre-pm-fit products: **they like to optimize things**. You need a forceful resistance to spending too much time on optimization, rearchitecting, refactoring, et al until it's the right time (i.e. the go-to-market fit stage). As builders or technologists, most of us bristle at the idea of doing something the quick and dirty way. We have that urge to automate, analyze, and streamline things. It’s not to say that there’s zero space for this; we’re talking trade-offs. If you spend literally zero time on a sustainable foundation, then p-m fit clicks and it’s time to scale up, you’ll be building on an unstable ground (see the extensive literature on technical debt here).

There’s no “correct” approach here. It depends on so many factors. In my first-hand experience, and from sideline observations of other teams, companies are **made** by favoring effectiveness early and **broken** by ignoring efficiency later.
